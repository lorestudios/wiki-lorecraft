# Welcome Lorecraft

Lorecraft is a creative Minecraft server for builders. It is home to a small community of active builders that enjoy creating amazing terrain, structures and organics together.

We hold regular competitions and events that anyone can be a part of including prize pools and gifts to make the creative process exciting!

## Network Layout

Lorecraft has several worlds that you can freely join, including the Village (32x plots), the Meadows (512x plots), and worlds that we hold our community events in.

## Events

Events are held in special worlds that are only open for building in during the event period. Current and past events can be seen by using the command `/hints` in game. Past community event worlds can be visited to see a showcase of the amazing submissions.

::: warning
Event worlds are closed from building after the event period ends. Make sure to save any plots or builds that you want to continue work on _before_ the event period ends.

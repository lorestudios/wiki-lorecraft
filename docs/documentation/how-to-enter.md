## Judging Criteria
There are generally 5 areas of interest for our judges to focus on:

- Creativity
- Design
- Color
- Form
- Language

### Creativity
Creativity is the originality of the build, including uniqueness and new ideas or techniques on display.

### Design
Design is the cohesiveness of the build, including the composition, layout, lighting, and clarity of details.

### Color
Color is the use of hues, saturation, and contrast with block palettes to provide depth and richness to builds.

### Form
Form is the quality of shape design including surfaces, volumes, negative spaces, and the flow of lines between them all.

### Language
Language is the visual story and the ability for the build to express the intended idea or theme.

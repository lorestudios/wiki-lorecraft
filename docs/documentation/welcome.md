## Plugins

One of the key features of our server is the use of custom plugins that empower our community to be more productive and creative. These tools allow builders to easily create and build in ways that would not be possible on a traditional Minecraft server. Additionally, our Dev Team is always open to suggestions to improve the experience for our members, and actively works to keep the network running smoothly.

Here, members can share their builds, give and receive feedback, and just hang out and have fun. The community is incredibly supportive and always willing to lend a helping hand to new members.

## Servers

We also have powerful servers from OVH located in Canada, providing the best US/EU pings for a worldwide community experience. This ensures that everyone can enjoy building and creating on our server, no matter where they are located.

## Welcome home!

# Schematics

Schematics are how we save and share builds in Minecraft (Java Edition). You can download schematics directly from Lorecraft or upload ones you have on your PC to Lorecraft to work on! You can also download whole plots in certain plot worlds (Gardens, Meadows, and Plains).

## Uploading schematics

To upload schematics visit https://schematic.lorecraft.online/. Simply click on the browse button and select the **schematic file** from your PC (schematic files have the extension _.schem_ or _.schematic_) and upload! You will be given a key that you can add to the following command:

**`//schem load schem url:<download key>`**

<CustomImage

    alt="logo"
    width="100%"
    height="auto"
    opacity="100"
    alignFrom="center"
    isBg="false"
    marginTop="50px"
    marginBottom="10px"
    marginLeft="0px"
    marginRight="20px"
/>

## Downloading Schematics

To download a **schematic** you first need to select a region and add it to your clipboard. `//pos1` in one corner of your selection area, and then `//pos2` in the opposite corner, followed by `//copy` to save the selection to the clipboard.

Then run the following command and open the link in your chat window in game:

**`/download`**

## Downloading Plots

To download a plot, make sure you are in one of the worlds that has this feature enabled (Gardens, Meadows, and Plains). This will allow you to download a whole plot to a schematic file, where you can use at home or in other servers!

Simply run the following command and open the link in your chat window in game:

**`//plot download`**
